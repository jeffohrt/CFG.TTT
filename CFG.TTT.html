<div id="Intro">
<p>Growing up in rural Nova Scotia in the 1970s and 80s is best described as 'The Hunger Games' where subsistance fishing, hunting and trapping was a daily chore.  While now-a-days everyone looks at me like I am crazy when I describe carrying an axe, knife and gun from the age of 12 and having to rely on harvesting animals to eat, everyone I knew growing up had the same chores.

<p>I had lots of favorites; trout fishing in April with my Uncle, dipping kayiak (gaspereau or ale wives) in May, hand lining and mackerel fishing in the summer, lobster fishing all winter etc.

<p>However hunting with my Grandfather was a particular treat.  Grandpa and I hung and skinned every deer the family shot.  Grandpa taught me to make rawhide from deer skins by nailing the hide across the cellar door.  I learned hair-on processes when I started tying flies as a teenager.  My absolute favorite with Grandpa was rabbit hunting.

<p>From the close of deer season (December) to the end of rabbit season (February), my Grandpa would come up every day when I got home from school and take me snaring and shooting.

<p>It was not until I was home in 2018, 3 years after Grandpa's death (at 93), snaring in a February rain storm for 2 weeks that my Uncle mentioned Grandpa didn't like rabbits.  It seems his family had a stretch of a decade or three where that was the only meat they had.  Rabbits reminded him too much of a tough childhood.

<p>I still love snaring over traditional shooting.

<div id="Dispatch">
<h1>Harvesting vs Dispatching</h1>
<p>It is PC (Politically Correct) to refer to taking an animal's life as 'harvesting' an animal.  This generally implies taking (killing) the animal in a legally allowed method.</p>
<p>The specific method of death is often misunderstood.</p>
<p>In the course of trapping or snaring the trapper will frequently encounter an animal that needs to be dispatched - it needs to be killed because it is not dead yet.  This can occur when restraining / non-killing traps are used or it can occur when an animal is caught improperly.
<p>It is commonly assumed trappers carry a gun and that they shoot their animals to dispatch them.
<p>This is not always the case.  Even a 22 is too much for smaller animals.  A shot would damage too much of the hide.  Or the trapper doesn't have one, doesn't carry one, didn't bring one that day or just generally prefers not to use one because of the holes in the hides.
<p>Some of the more common ways to dispatch an animal without a gun are to drown it, use a catch pole with a killing snare, step on it's head), hit it on the head (sometimes the bridge of the nose, sometimes the back of the skull), step on it's chest (crushing heart and lungs) or to catch it by the head in a conibear trap.
<p>Trappers generally don't stab an animal to death, slit its throat or similar gruesome methods as it destroys the pelt and there are much easier, less upsetting methods.
<h2>It is important to be familiar with multiple ways to safely dispatch an animal for those situations where your primary method is not available.</h2>
<dl>
<dt><h3>Bloodloss</h3>
<dd><p>Arrows and Bolts (Bows and Crossbows) are designed to be razor sharp, cutting a wide wound channel through critical organs (heart and lungs ideally) causing massive bloodloss, unconciousness and death.
<dt><h3>Blunt Force</h3>
<dd><p>The most common blunt force dispatch is a blow to the head or skull.  Done properly, the animal is stunned and killed in a single blow.  Some choose to use a blow to the skull to stun and possibly kill while using a follow-up weight on the lungs and heart to stop blood flow and oxygen.  <i>Follow-Up weight can be a boot (and body weight) but is more often a knee (and body weight) as it tends to be cleaner.  This is done by depressing the lungs and heart and holding them depressed so they can not function.  It is not kicking.</i>
<dt><h3>Shock and Tissue Damage</h3>
<dd><p>Bullets are designed to transfer energy to the target causing major tissue damage, breaking bone and incapacitating the animal long enough for shock and blood loss to cause unconciousness and death.
<dd><p>Direct hits to the CNS (Central Nervous System) like the head, neck or spine being the most common.  These are quite small targets on a moving animal thus the 'heart and lung' shot is generally the prefered shot.
<dd><p>Hydrostatic shock is occurs in a high energy transfer causing 'waves' of energy to disrupt or destroy the CNS.  The visual is of knocking the animal down, stunning it long enough for bloodloss to render it unconcious and then death.
<dd><p>The classic 'heart and double lung' shot is viewed as the most humane shot as it presents the largest target, moving the least, that causes a rapid, humane death, by shock and bloodloss.
<dt><h3>Drowning</h3>
<dd><p>Many trapping / snaring sets using drowning equipment.  This equipment forces the animal underwater where lack of oxygen renders it unconcious and then dead.
<dt><h3>Snaring</h3>
<dd><p>Arguably the most commonly misunderstood form of death is a snare.
<ul><li><p><b>Restraining</b> snares ideally do no damage to the animal.  It is simply held until the trapper arrives to decide if it will be harvested or released.  These snares have 'relaxing locks' that tighten when the animal struggles and release slightly when the animal stops struggling.
<li><p><b>Killing</b> snares ideally do not choke the animal in the sense it's breathing is stopped.  Snares, set properly, cut off blood to the brain (carotid arteries in the neck) causing unconciousness and then death.  These snares have 'locks' that tighten when the animal struggles and do not relax if the animal stops struggling.
<li><p><b>Powered Killing</b> snares use a spring to tighten the snare all but instantaneously.  Unlike regular killing snares, these snares do not require the animal to struggle to tighten.  The snares are fired like a trap.
</ul>
<dt><h3>Conibears (body gripping traps)</h3>
<dd><p>Conibear traps were invented by Canadian Frank Conibear in the 1950s.
<dd><p>Ideally this trap harvests the animal by :
<ul>
<li><p>the neck - breaking the neck (CNS) and compressing the carotid arteries, cutting off blood to the brain causing unconciousness and death.  This is called a head catch.
<li><p>the body / chest - breaking the back (CNS) and compressing the lungs causing unconciousness and death.  This is called a suitcase catch.
<li><p>drowning - conibears are commonly used in and around water to drown the animal in the case of a head or suitcase catch failing.
</ul>
<p>Conibears are ideally suited to 'dog proofing' - being set in manners that reduce or eliminate the risk to domestic animals.  The most common regulations include setting them in, over or near water.  Or setting them 5 ft (1.5 m) in the air (up a tree or similarly angled log).
</dl>

<h2>Other Peeps</h2>
<p>There are many trapping channels on Youtube but with rules and policies and the like no-one shows dispatching and few show true skinning / butchering videos.
<p>If you are a regular watcher of said channels you'll pick-up over time how they do what.  Here's a list :

<h2>Dispatch by 22</h2>

<p>I grew up using a 22 for hunting and trapping.  The 3 rounds I keep handy are a 22 short, 22 LR and 22 Mag.
<p>I use 22 short on the smallest critters (rabbits) for dispatching.  Shooting at a distance I use a 22 LR.
<p>22 LR does NOT come in Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) and the round breaks up against the skull and can skitter down the hide, knicking it along the way.  I prefer to wait for a quartering away head shot so the bullet path is moving away from the body.
<p>22 Mag FMJ - I don't trust bears.  They get a 22 FMJ in the skull and if I am the least bit cautious, I'll give them a second one.

<p><i>.223 (Civilian) and 5.56 (Milspec) are identical in dimensions - thus each can be chambered in the other.  However, the powder charges differ.  With the .223 62 gr rnd producing 52-55k psi in pressure vs the 5.56 62 gr rnd producing 70k psi.  Making it safe to fire a 223 rnd in a milspec rifle, but generally unsafe to fire milspec ammo in a 223 rifle.</i>

<div id="Snaring">
<h1>Snaring</h1>

<h2>Brass or Stainless</h2>

<p>As a kid, 22 gauge (1/32 of an inch, 0.030 inches or 0.8 mm) brass wire was the only option for making snares.  Most stores sold it in 20 ft (6.1 m) coils.  Depending on rabbit snare styles, you could get 12-16 snares from a coil.  If you were lucky you could get a couple, perhaps 3 or 4 rabbits from a snare before metal fatigue set in and the snare couldn't be trusted.  In 2017, running entirely new snares, I snapped 2 (out of 50 brass snares).  In 2018, running last year's snares I snapped 2 more.

<p>In 2017, when I returned from over-seas to snare for a couple weeks, I made and tried stainless steel snares.  It was sold in the same size ... 22 gauge, 20 ft (6.1 m of 0.8 mm) for the same price.

<p>A couple notes on brass vs stainless.  Brass has a tensile strength of 50000 psi vs stainless' 75000 psi.  Brass is softer and more susceptible to fatigue.  As a personal note, I always catch a few squirrels in brass snares.  I have never caught one in stainless snares - they are that bit stiffer.  The squirrel pushes it out of the way before it tightens.  That extra bit of stiffness saves them.

<h2>Buying Snare Wire</h2>

<p>You can go to any hardware store where I live and buy brass or stainless snare wire for about $3.50 per 20 ft (6 m).  However, stainless steel mig wire is the same size and much cheaper, but you do have to buy quite a bit.

<table border=20>

<tr><td>0.045</td><td>180</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.060</td><td>100</td></tr>
</table>

<p>So, on Amazon, for $40 Canadian, (free shipping) I can get a 2 lb spool of 0.030 (22 gauge) 308 stainless steel mig wire.  2 lbs of 0.030 wire should be 800 ft, or 640 snares or 6&cents; each.

<p>Hardware stores are selling the same wire, in 20 ft coils for $3.50, or 22&cents; per snare.

<p>Granted, there are commercial fishing outlets that sell the same stainless steel as leaders for shark fishing.  A 20 ft coil there is still $2 ... 12&cents; each.

<p>End result, a $20, 1 lb spool of 0.030 stainless mig wire should last a long long time.

<div id="BaitStation">
<h1>Bait Stations</h1>

<p>Baiting animals for the purposes of hunting is either legal or illegal where you are hunting.  MAKE SURE WHICH.</p>
<p>Where I am from, baiting deer and bear was both legal and common.</p>

<h2>Salt Station</h2>

<p>A salt station is exactly what it sounds like.  A spot you leave salt for animals.  They get use to it and come frequently.</p>
<p>Salt licks can be purchased at animal / farm supply shops and often hardware or similar hunting stores.</p>
<p>Generally a good idea to keep such things off the ground to minimize the spread of disease and parasites.</p>
<p>A particularly good trick, especially for salt stations, which works for bear as well as deer either on their own or in combination with a food station, is to either cut down a tree creating a stump that is knee or waist high, or to select a station where such a stump or downed tree already exists.</p>
<p>Cut the stump off flat on top.  Use an axe and / or drill to hollow it out enough to make a shallow bowl.</p>
<p>Put the mineral / salt block in the 'bowl' and pour water over it to start the leeching effect.</p>
<p>Each visit, and when it rains, the water will fill the bowl and slowly leech the salt into the stump.  The salt stump will last a year or more as the animals slowly chew away at it to get the salt and minerals.</p>
<p>Naturally these should be along or near game trails.  Animals won't magically appear in the middle of nowhere without a really really good reason.  Scent trails (honey pots) can be used to pull in bears but deer need to both get use to and naturally be close by to a station to discover it and make it worth the daily trip.</p>

<h2>Deer Liquid Bait</h2>

<dl>
    <dt><h3>Molasses</h3></dt>
    <dd><p>This is molasses, salt and water.  The water can be warm or hot just to make dissolving the salt easier.  The molasses can be the animal grade version from a farm supply store.  The salt can be pickling salt.  These are the cheapest sources of salt and molasses.</p></dd>
    <dd><p>For each litre (or kg) of molasses, dissolve 1 cup of salt into 1 litre of water.  Mix everything together.  The water is just to make it easier to pour / splash around.  You can use less to make it a little thicker.</p></dd>
    
    <dt><h3>Strawberry</h3></dt>
    <dd><p>In a 4 L / 1 gallon jug (rinsed out milk jug works well) :</p></dd>
    <dd><ul>
    <li><p>2 packs of strawberry jello</p></li>
    <li><p>1-2 parts (use jello boxes) of salt</p></li>
    <li><p>2 bottles of strawberry syrup</p></li>
    <li><p>1 bottle (1 L'ish) of corn syrup</p></li>
    </ul></dd>
    <dd><p>Shake well, thin with water if desired.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>At your salt / bait station, splash the liquid bait around.  Splash it up on trees, especially downed / dead trees.  The wind will carry the smell to deer.  They'll come investigate if they feel safe and stay to eat the sugary salty goodness.</p>

<p>You can also mix this with cracked corn (very cheap corn from the farm supply shop).</p>

<p>This will occassionally pull in a bear if they are around.</p>

<h2>Honey Pot</h2>

<p>This is quite specific to pulling in a bear to a salt or bait station.</p>

<p>You'll need 2 cans, one that fits inside the other.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><p>1 Hole in the bottom of the big can</p></dt>
    <dd><p>&rarr; drill a large hole an inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom that is big enough for a propane torch, BBQ lighter or long match </p></dd>
    <dd><p>alternatively, use one of those old school triangle can opener deals.</p></dd>
    <dd><p>Don't put too many in, you want a slow burn that won't get blown out by a wind.</p></dd>
    
    <dt><p>2 holes in the top of the big can</p></dt>
    <dd><p>The big can is going to be hung high up in the air - well out of reach of a bear.</p></dd>
    <dd><p>Because this can will be both hot and on fire (for a short time), the 'handle' needs to be some kind of wire.  Drill a couple holes in the top of the can and run some rabbit wire through them.  That's plenty.</p></dd>
    
    <dt><p>Option A : BBQ briquettes</p></dt>
    <dd><p>Put 1 or 2 BBQ briquettes in the can, put the second can with honey in ... ready to go.</p></dd>
    <dd><p>The briquettes act as spacers.  It takes a propane torch to light them but they burn longer than tea-candles and as they burn the can lowers and puts the last of the fire out.</p></dd>
    <dd><p><b>I prefer this method.</b></p></dd>

Or you can get a couple of rocks or bits of wood that are the right size and throw them in the can.  Rocks and wood work really well.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Test this out a few times before lighting the fire.  Sucks to learn the hard way it's going to fall on your head when it is on fire and full of honey.</p></dd>
    <dd><p>A long pole to left the handle up over a branch works well.  A simple pull-line also works.</p></dd>

<p>The fire will boil / burn the honey sending the smell through the forest to the bear.  The bear will follow the smell back to your salt / bait station and become a regular visitor if your station is good enough.  I also pull them to snares this way.</p>
<p>Some peeps add star anise (strong licorice smell) to their honey pots.</p>


</div>
<div id="TrapLure">
<p>Trapping lures are very aromatic - they smell.  The general idea being to get somebody's attention and draw them towards the trap or snare.</p>
<p>Some smell like food - see the honey pots in Bait Stations.</p>
<p>Some smells trigger territorial aggression - like beaver castor.</p>
<p>Some smells trigger territorial marking - like fox or coyote urine.</p>
<p>Some smells are curiosity based.

<h2>Beaver Castor</h2>

<p>Beaver Castor is the musk gland of a beaver.  They tend to be quite large and full.  They can be dried and sold or used in an aggression or curiosity lure.</p>
<p>Castor can be used raw - just cut it up and keep it in a jar - or it can be kept from drying out by mixing in some vaseline.</p>
<p>Some peeps also add star anise (licorice smell) to their castor / vaseline jar.</p>

<h2>Urine</h2>
<p>One of the easiest - check to make sure it's legal - is to harvest urine and keep it in a squirt bottle.
<p>This is quite common with trapping coyotes and foxes.  Placing urine of a foreign animal on a post or similar object attracts the locals who feel they must mark over this urine with their own.  Traps are bedded so the critter must step in one to stand correctly to re-mark with their own urine.
<p>Urine can also be used to 'overpower' the smell of humans or traps when making a set.</p>

<p>Urine of a female in heat can also be used to attract males.</p>

<div id="Tanning">
<h1>Tanning</h1>

<p>Tanning is the process of cleaning, de-greasing and preserving a hide to produce a leather.
<p>Specifically, the proteins and fibers are chemically and mechanically altered to produce softer more durable or wear / rot / weather / insect resistant textiles.

<h2>Alum Tawing</h2>

<p>This is not a true tanning process.  Alum(inum sulphate) is a desiccant.  It dries out things.  A hide, soaked in a solution of alum, will actually remove physical water from the hide.  This causes cells to shrink and grip more tightly to hairs and hair follicles, resulting in much less slippage.

<p>This process is sufficient for non-textile uses like rugs or taxidermy and functions as an excellent preparation step in 'brain tanning'.

<h2>Brain Tanning</h2>

<p>Brain tanning, can use brains, or other sources of oils.  The tanning solutions is an emulsified oil.  The hide is coated or soaked in the emulsion.  The oils displace the physical water in the hides and lubricate the collagen fibers.  This process is often locked in with a cold smoke.  A mix of egg yolk, vegetable oil and soap is an excellent 'brain tanning' solution.

<h2>Vegetable Tanning</h2>

<p>Tannins and tannic acids from tree barks are concentrated in water by boiling (and allowing to cool).  Hides are soaked in this solution.  The tannins enter the collagen (protein) matrix and replace both physical and chemical water with phenolic groups from the tannins.  This stabilizes the collagen and makes it resistant to decomposition.

<p>This process is generally slow and in the case of thicker hides can take months.

<h2>Chromium Tanning</h2>

<p>Chromium salts are put in solution and rubbed into the hides or the hides are soaked in the solution.  Either way the chromium salts cross-link the collagen matrix, stabilizing.  This process is very quick and even a thick hide can be done in a day.

<h2>Pre-Tanning</h2>

<dl>
<dt>SKIN
<dd><p>Skin fresh or thaw hide from freezer, rinse off blood etc.

<dt>FLESH or WET SCRAPE
<dd><p>Scrape fat and meat off hide with fleshing knife, on fleshing beam while the hide is green or damp.
<dd><p>FLESHing knives are typically duller.  Thus results in fewer, smaller, accidental cuts and a process that is much faster (than DRY SCRAPE).
<dd><p>Bear fat can be rendered for re-use.
<dd><p>Many animals, including dogs and cats, love hide scrapings as snacks.
<dd><p>rinse well to remove the last of the blood, fat etc

<dt>DRY SCRAPE
<dd><p>The hide is stretched across a frame and allowed to dry completely.  It is a slow process.
<dd><p>The hide is then scraped while dry using a very sharp adze like tool.  This leads to more frequent and larger accidental cuts in the hide.
<dd><p>DRY SCRAPing is done specifically to thin thick hides like buffalo or moose.
<dd><p>DRY SCRAPing is also done as a hair removal process.

<dt>DE-GREASE
<dd><p>using Dawn dish soap or similar, wash hide (to remove blood, fat etc), rinse well and slat or snap dry
<dd><p>fatty animals like bear, beaver and raccoon, or poorly fleshed ones, may need to be de-greased more than once.

<dt>RINSING & SCUDDING
<dd><p>Rinsing between processes is always a good idea.  It helps to remove tissue, blood etc.  It also helps when degreasing etc to rinse well.
<dd><p>SCUDDING is a lot like squee-jee-ing the hide.  The rinsed hide is placed on the fleshing beam and fleshed / scraped with a fleshing knife.  This will remove some of the minor bits left behind or raised by the wet process.  This will also, very efficiently, push water out of the hide and fur.
<dd><p>SCUDDING often produces a white or milky solution.  Don't worry, that is normal.

<dt>BUCKing / LIME(ing) (de-hairing)
<dd><p>The hide (usually green / fresh) is soaked in an alkali solution, often made from hydrated lime (gardening supplies).
<dd><p>The alkali solution causes the grain (follicle holding layer of membrane) to swell.  This makes the hair slip (hair removal process) and makes the membrane easier to remove (WET SCRAPE).
<dd><p>The alkali solution / WET SCRAPE also removes a mucus layer that is otherwise not removed completely.
<dd><p>Soak for 2 days to leach out lime with frequent water changes.
<dd><p>Neutralize pH with vinegar.  Soak for 10-15 min.
<dd><p>Flesh again to remove more membrane.

<dt>GRAINING or FRIZZING (frizzy)
<dd><p>Flesh the HAIR SIDE to remove the GRAIN (membranes and hair follicles)


<dt>STRETCH
<dd><p>Stretch the hide into the desired shape and hold it that way with nails, strings or staples.
<dd><p>Stretching can also refer to more of a kneeding process of stretching fibers to expose tanning solutions more effectively while also drying the hide

<dt>REPAIR
<dd><p>Sew up holes.  Trim ragged edges.

<dt>SALT
<dd><p>Keep the hide stretched and close to but not perfectly flat.  Cover the hide side in a generous layer of non-iodised salt.  Use a fine grained salt, not a rough, large kernel rock salt.
<dd><p>The salt will pull moisture out of the hide and the incline will allow it to run off.  This very effectively dries the hide.
<dd><p>Check each day, anywhere the salt is damp, scrape it off and replace it with generous dry salt.  Particularly fatty animals like a raccoon, beaver or bear may require several salt changes to dry.
<dd><p>Salt dried hides can be stored for very long periods of time as they are extremely resistant to rot, molds and insects.

</dl>

<h2>Post-Tanning</h2>

<dl>
<dt>SMOKE
<dd><p>Tanned hides are often COLD SMOKED.  This closes up pores in the leather (it's leather now) and coats the leather in tars and creosotes to help water, weather and insect 'proof' the leather.
<dd><p>Coals covered in dried / rotted woods work well.
<dd><p>CAREFUL not to burn, cook or singe the leather or hairs.  Use COLD smoke.
<dd><p>Can be done in the rafters of a smoke house, dedicated smoke house or the hide can be rolled and temporarily sewn into a 'chimney' and smoked that way.
<dd><p>Smoke until the desired color is reached (some variation of honey / brown).

<dt>PRE-SMOKE
<dd><p>Particularly when brain tanning, hides are often brained, broken and smoked but not to completion.
<dd><p>Instead, a brained, broken, smoked hide is returned to the brain solution.  The effect is 2 fold.
<ol><li><p>re-braining, re-breaking, re-smoking, drives the chemicals deeper into the hide as well as further softens the hide producing a superior product.<li><p>The 'smoke' leaches into the brain solution, both preserving it as well as producing a deeper brain / smoke of the hide.</ol>

<h2>Taw / Tawing = Alum "Tanning"</h2>

<p>Tawing (using alum or aluminum salts) is NOT a true tanning process.  More of a salting / preservation process.  Very easy and forgiving, ideal for carpets, throws and taxidermy.  NOT for textiles or materials that will be washed as water will wash out the preserving chemicals.
<p>Very good for locking hair in a hide.  Excellent as a more effective salting process for pre-tanning storage.
<p>Tawing is particularly well known in taxidermy circles and produces a superior egg tanned hide when tawing, not salting, is used as a pre-treatment stage.

<dd>coat green / damp / flexible hide with generous layer of alum paste
<dd>leave flat, paste side up, with air circulating under to dry the hair side, for at least 2 weeks, longer, even 6 months, is better
<dd>leave at least until alum paste dries and flakes off

<dd><p>BREAK or SOFTEN
<dd><p>you can gently soften the hide while the alum paste dries by stretching the hide daily

<dt>ALUM PASTE Option B

<dd><p>Mix equal parts Borax and Alum with enough water to make a thick paste.
<dd><p>Spread generously on hide, at least 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick, rub into hide (wear gloves) and leave at a slight incline for 24 hrs

<dd><p>Scrape old paste off and replace with fresh paste each day for 5 days.
<dd><p>For the last coating, leave in place for 3-4 days.  Entire process takes 8-10 days.

<h2>Brain Tanning</h2>

<blockquote>
<h2>Brain Tanning - Hair Off</h2>

<p>A true tanning process and one of the oldest.  It is ideal for making buckskin, textiles and clothing.
</blockquote>

<dl>
<dt>SKIN
<dt>FLESH
<dt>GRAIN

<dt>REPAIR

<dt>BRAIN
<dd><p>The brain of the animal has enough lecithin (oil) to tan it's own hide (urban legend - a buffalo does not).  So 1 brain per hide.  You can substitute 1 dozen egg yolks (not whites) per hide (deer hide) or supplement brain with a couple yolks.
<dd><p>You do not need the very same brain / hide ... if you can source brains elsewhere use them.  A cow's brain to tan a deer hide is fine.

<dd><p>Puree (with machine or by hand) using an equal amount of warm water.  Some people boil/simmer the brains to soften them and then puree.

<dt>BRAIN - Wet Process (usually used for hair=off buckskin)
<dd><p>Dilute the brain solution to a volume that will just cover the full hide, submerged with a weight.
<dd><p>Soak the hide in the brain solution for 24 hrs.  Removing hide and wringing it out (dripping excess back into the brain solution) 3 or 4 times to promote absorption.
<dd><p>Wringing the hide is most effective with donut and stick technique.

<dt>BRAIN - 'Dry' Process (usually used for hair=on)
<dd><p>Keep brain solution as strong as possible (as little water as possible).
<dd><p>Pour solution on skinned, fleshed, de-greased, stretched hide.
<dd><p>Pour on gradually, rubbing into the hide as you go.  Once hide has a generous 'layer' of brain applied, allow it to soak in, dry(ish), before continuing.
<dd><p>If the brain solution is running off the hide, it is too thin and / or you have added too much.
<dd><p>Repeat until entire brain is applied.  Keeping the solution warm (not cooked) will help it soak in well.  (The heat opens the pores in the hide.)
<dd><p>Allow final application to dry(ish) and then fold / roll up the hide, brain-side in.
<dd><p>Leave the brain to soak in and soften the hide.  Small hides need only a few hours.


<dt>BREAKING or SOFTENING
<dd><p>Wring out well one last time OR SNAP / SLAT dry.
<dd><p>Pull and Stretch over breaking post or softening post until dry and supple. 2-10 hrs depending on hide and weather.  Softened dry hide will be warm (on your cheek) due to friction.  Wet hides remain cool.
<dd><p>Improperly done, the hide will dry out hard.
<dd><p>This will separate and break-up the fibers.  This will result in a color change, from a darker, harder hide to a softer, whiter leather.

<dt>SMOKING
<dd><p>COLD SMOKE hide.  Closes pores in the hide.  Makes the hide durable, rot resistant, water / weather resistant, insect resistant.
<dd><p>Smouldering, rotten wood works best.  People argue over hardwood vs soft (especially spruce).
<dd><p>Some hang the hides in the rafters of houses with a central fire pit.
<dd><p>Some hang the hides in a traditional smoke house.
<dd><p>Some sew the hides together (temporarily) to make 'chimneys' to funnel smoke through.
<dd><p>Some cover a rack with hides or tarps and funnel smoke into a temporary tarp / dome.  (Think hot-boxing your hide.)
<dd><p>Hides are smoked to the desired color.  A small hide may be done in 30 min or just a couple hours.  A large bear may take several days to smoke.
